HINT: Postman is an awesome tool to start making API Requests with to see what data comes back and how you'll want to manage that data in your React Components.

Wed 4/4/18 start: 6:30pm - 12:30am (6 hours) - about to list the 50 beers and the 50 breweries, trouble with pagination, completely impossible task of listing a single beer or brewery.
  Note: The bundle exec foreman start does not work
  Note: It would be really nice if you either 1) made the assessment something that we could actually do, or 2) prepared us for what we would need to do. I am not an idiot and I can't magically type in enough random characters to make these Postman requests actually show me what I need and because you are only allow us to use custom end points, we have no way of searching how to do figure it out on our own. Maybe at least give us some idea of how to actually use Postman in class if the entire assessment depends on our ability to use it.
