HINT: Postman is an awesome tool to start making API Requests with to see what data comes back and how you'll want to manage that data in your React Components.

Wed 4/4/18 start: 6:30pm - 1:30am (7 hours, 1 hour of coding, 6 hours of fighting with Postman due to api changes, see note below) 
PART 1: Done. Listed the 50 beers and the 50 breweries
  TODO: trouble with pagination.
  NOTE: The bundle exec foreman start does not work
  NOTE: Found a bug, the api changed and no longer allows for /apo/beer/:name,      now they use :id, but that also doesn't work.
